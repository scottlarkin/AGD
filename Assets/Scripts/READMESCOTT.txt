Ok so I'm trying to give you a brief overview of what I've done. Bear in mind it is now 8am, I'm shattered
 and there is a good chance this will make no sense and that I'll miss bits.

- Changed HangingBasket to now be able to detect players above and below and made the detection more accurate. So really this should be a
fallingObjects script now. Didn't want to change without discussion. Yes it isn't perfect, 
and you will cringe at an if statement near the top, it's 8 am, fuck you.

- The UI is now implemented, no it isn't perfect. But it works for now. I need to work on some maths 
for dividing the screen better, but thats for another day. Also UI is designed for 1920 x 1080, not tested on other resolutions.

- I fixed my attack and changed player prefab slightly. The attack scales, although numbers prob need adjusting. 
I still need to work on block, it works but the animation is a dick.

- Your camera breaks when there are three players, especially when one dies. It gets an error.
 I was going to investigate but didn't want to upset your 'amazing' camera script.

- Think your jump is still bugged. Unsure.

- Nope that's it brain has shut down now.. So I will discuss this stuff further with you later today.
